write a pythonprogram to print all the arithmetic operations

# Python Program to Perform Arithmetic Operators
a = float(input("Enter first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Addition of two numbers
sum = a + b 

# Subtraction of two numbers
difference = a - b

# Multiplication of two numbers
multiplication = a * b

# Division of two numbers
division = a / b

# Modulus of two numbers 
mod = a % b

# Exponent
exp = a ** b

# Displaying output
print("The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}" .format(a, b, sum))
print("The difference of {0} and {1} is {2}" .format(a, b, difference))
print("The multiplication of {0} and {1} is {2}" .format(a, b, multiplication))
print("The division of {0} and {1} is {2}" .format(a, b, division))
print("The modulus of {0} and {1} is {2}" .format(a, b, mod))
print("The exponent value of {0} and {1} is {2}" .format(a, b, exp))


outpu:- Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 2
The sum of 10.0 and 2.0 is 12.0
The difference of 10.0 and 2.0 is 8.0
The multiplication of 10.0 and 2.0 is 20.0
The division of 10.0 and 2.0 is 5.0
The modulus of 10.0 and 2.0 is 0.0
The exponent value of 10.0 and 2.0 is 100.0
